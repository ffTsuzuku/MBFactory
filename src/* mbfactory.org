* mbfactory

** Goal
A very generic data seeder. Easily generate all types of entities and data by 
describing them or using p

Generate Me 10 People who are defined as 
{
    ID: Number, 
    FName: Name,
    LName: Name,
    Email: EAddress
}

** Implementation

People Will Create facotry instance

#+BEGIN_SRC TS
type Person {
    id: number,
    fname: string,
    lname: string,
    email: Email
}

type Email {

}

const factory = new Factory()

factory.generate(type, quantity)
#+END_SRC

Going to need predefined entity types like People


* Generating a date
By Default it will generate either today or a date in the past. 

Can generate a date between a range (max and min)
    params can be a number or string representation. 

    Date.parse will convert them to unix timestamp 

    Then random number will be generated between the timestamps and returned.
